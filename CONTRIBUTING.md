## Contributing

We're using github issues to track people working on things. If you'd like to
contribute a guide or a competency statement:

1. open an issue to track the work. The title of the issue should say something like "Guide: java programming" or "Competency statement: Leading on getting well defined tasks from backlog to production". Add any notes you feel necessary in the body of the issue
2. clone the repo and make a PR for the proposed changes

## Guidelines for contributed content

* since this guide is public, please avoid any personally identifiable information in any contributions

If you're not sure about anything, email us at gds-tech-learning-path-discuss (at) digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk to ask.

### What should go in a guide

* Cover a single topic, and consider splitting guides that are too long.
* It's ok to be opinionated, but aim to acknowledge multiple approaches where possible.
* Introduce the topic, mentioning any assumed knowledge at the start.
* Don't use a guide to document technical decisions or conventions we follow within GDS. Instead link to something canonical like the [GDS Technical Guidance](https://gds-tech-docs.cloudapps.digital/#gds-technical-guidance).
