## Contributing

We're using github issues to track people working on things. If you'd like to
contribute a guide or a competency statement:

1. open an issue to track the work. The title of the issue should say something like "Guide: java programming" or "Competency statement: Leading on getting well defined tasks from backlog to production". Add any notes you feel necessary in the body of the issue
2. clone the repo and make a PR for the proposed changes
