# Learning pathways at GDS

This website exists to bring together the GDS Technology community's collective knowledge and resources to support the learning and development of technologists.

## Goals

We want to:

- create a set of curated guides, organised by topic, technology, constituency, level. There may be multiple cross-cutting routes into the resources. Our aim is to offer pathways which cater for the most important needs of technologists.
- elaborate the current [technologists career pathways within GDS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) in more detail, by creating a page for each competency statement in the career path.
- prepare for adopting the [DDaT career pathways within GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-job-roles-in-government#technical:-software-developer-) by documenting our current career pathway in more detail.
