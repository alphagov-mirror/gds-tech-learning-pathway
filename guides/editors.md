# Using editors

Using editors effectively can greatly increase the speed at which we can try new ideas and approaches.

Editor choice and configuration is often very personal, however you should be considerate of the needs of people who you pair with in your choice of editor/configuration.

Broadly there are three classes of editor:

- IDEs - IntelliJ, RubyMine (Eclipse?)
- Plain text editor - Sublime Text, Atom
- Vim and Emacs

Examples of ways you can improve your workflow

- Automatic linting to detect problems quicker
- Autocompletion
- Code generation
- Quicker and safer refactoring
- Shortcuts for common dev tasks (eg run the tests)
- Quicker navigation between and within files in your projects
- Using the debugger

Status: **early draft**

Todo:
- Say more about the different types of editors (IDEs vs Plaintext vs Vim vs Emacs) - what is an IDE, why do people use it, why do some people not use it
