## Leading on delivering stories

### The developers role

- to figure out how to deliver a user story in the most appropriate way
- to consider and balance short and long term impacts of implementation choices
- to ensure that code produced is of the appropriate quality (which will be different for a prototype vs a live production service)
- to ensure that all parts of a codebase are known by many developers on the team

### Junior level

At junior level, you will be given support to work on user stories. You will normally work in a pair with a more experienced developer. You may be asked to take the lead on well defined stories. 

A well defined story will:

- have clear acceptance criteria, so that you know when you're done
- have a clear statement of which files, classes, tests, microservices will need to change, and in what way
