## Testing guide

## What you should be able to do


## Starting out
- Know about the different types of tests
- Know which framework to use depending on the type of test
- What makes a "good test"

### Junior level

At junior level, you will normally work with another more experienced developer who will help you with test driven development (TDD). With guidance you will learn what tests to write and how to make them pass. 

A good test is generally defined to:
- have a clear description, so that any developer can understand it
- carry out one expectation
- have a useful error message, so that the issue can be easily located

### Mid level

- Lead in a pairing session, guiding a less experienced developer on writing good tests and making them pass
- Refactoring tests, to ensure when new tests are added they are not duplicates of other current tests 

### Senior level
