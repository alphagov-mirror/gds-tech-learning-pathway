# Version control

Version control facilitates collaboration amongst a team working on a shared code base. Each change to a code base includes a message explaining the reason for those changes. These messages provide useful context to future developers who may want to understand the reasoning behind different design decisions.

Version control also allows for controlled testing and deployment of known software versions, which is an essential part of any reliable quality control process. Nowadays this will typically be in the form of a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline.


## What you should be able to do

- Understand and follow your team’s branching and code review process
- Understand the benefits of having a clear commit history
- Write clear commit messages for your changes
- Participate in code review

## Starting out

- Be able to clone a git repository
- Be able to create a branch
- Be able to make commits with clear commit messages
- Be able to push changes
- Open a pull request
