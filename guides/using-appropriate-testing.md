Appropriate testing means:

- You should be familiar with the common testing frameworks in your language.
- Testing is a core part of delivering a feature.

- You test both the "happy path" and "sad path".

You should understand different types of testing and when to use them:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Functional testing
- Performance/Load testing
- Usability testing
- ...
