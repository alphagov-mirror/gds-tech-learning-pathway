# Owning your development plan

Developers should take responsibility for their continued learning and
development by forming a development plan.

## Your role as a developer

Developers should identify areas they are interested in and areas where they
have skill gaps and seek out suitable resources to help further their
understanding. This might include books, courses, self-study,
conferences, or [mentoring].

As well as the [technical skills](/technical-skills) and [working practices](/working-practices) discussed in this learning pathway, other sources of ideas on this topic include:

 * The [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/)
 * [GDS Wiki - Training and Development]
 * The Career pathways in the [Digital Data and Technology (DDaT) Profession Capability Framework][DDaT]

Your development plan should be reflected in at least one personal development objective and discussed with your line manager.

GDS wants to spend money on your personal development, and you can find out how to apply for that [on the GDS Wiki][GDS Wiki - L&D Budget].

### Junior level

You will probably have broad goals in your development plan as you become familiar
with the large surface area of modern development and web/dev ops.

As a junior you have 20% time where you can focus on things that will help your
development such as tutorials, books and projects.

You also have the opportunity to work on a project that is non-delivery related
but benefits GDS. A 20% project should have some specific learning outcomes and
pairing with other juniors is encouraged to help you support and learn from
each other.

There is a [spreadsheet of suggested 20% time projects].

You should discuss the project with your line manager before starting on it.

### Mid level

Your development plan may begin to focus more on higher level concepts, such as how to
design maintainable and scalable solutions.
You could focus on not only learning the intricacies of code, but also other skills that go into developing software like user research and writing good user stories.

Often a mid level plan will also include some [mentoring] or [other people management skills](/leading-and-communicating).

Presenting a topic to others is another excellent way to help spread knowledge through the organisation.

Specific technology learning might be project based. For example, if you are
working on search you might delve into Elasticsearch.

More ideas for personal development objectives are being collected in a [Google Doc][ideas doc].
