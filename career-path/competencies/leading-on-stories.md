## Leading on delivering stories

### The developers role

You should take responsibility for:
- figuring out how to deliver a user story in the most appropriate way
- considering and balancing short and long term impacts of implementation choices
- ensuring that code produced is of the appropriate quality (which will be different for a prototype vs a live production service)
- ensuring that your knowledge is shared amongst your team so that silos don't form

### Junior level

At junior level, you will be given support to work on user stories. You will normally work in a pair with a more experienced developer. You may be asked to take the lead on well defined stories. 

A well defined story will:

- have clear acceptance criteria, so that you know when you're done
- have a clear statement of which files, classes, tests, microservices will need to change, and in what way

### Mid level

At a more experienced level, we expect you to be able to lead on more complex stories.

### Senior level
