# External resources

This is a place to share learning resources with the wider tech community.

A good resource list should provide a path for learning about the topic (for example, you should separate introductary and advanced materials).

Here's a template you can use to create a new list:

```
#### [Topic]

[A short summary of the topic]

##### Starting out

In this section, write for someone who knows nothing about the topic. If talking about technology, give a simple runnable example. This section should introduce subtopics and terminology rather than going into depth.

#### [Other sections]

[Examples: important concepts, best practices, related technologies]

#### Reference documentation

[Official reference guides]

#### Learning materials

This can contain any kind of resource including blog posts, videos, books and tools. Draw attention to free materials, books in the GDS library, and internal training we run at GDS.
