# Puppet

Puppet is a domain specific language that describes the intended state of
computers. The name puppet is also used to refer to the software that runs on
those computers and makes configuration changes.

## Starting out

### Which version?

The language does vary between versions. Most, but not all, of the basic
language from older versions, such as 2.x and 3.x, will work on newer versions.

As a rule, start with the latest version, unless the team in which you work or
a tutorial you are following uses an older version.
