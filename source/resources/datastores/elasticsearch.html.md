## The ELK stack

ELK stands for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html).

Teams at GDS use this stack for [logging](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/logging.html#shared-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-elk-stack).
