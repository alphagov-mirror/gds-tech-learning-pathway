# Ways to learn

All civil servants are entitled to [5 days of learning and development each year](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/training-and-development-opportunities-in-the-the-civil-service).

Junior developers can use 20% of their time for learning, for example, by working on a self-contained project.

You can ask questions about learning and development in #ask-learning-and-devt on slack.

## Private study
It's ok to ask your team for time to study something.

Study materials could include books, videos, or guided tutorials.

GDS has a [library](https://gds-library.cloudapps.digital) and subscriptions to [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) that you can use.

If you know others with similar learning goals, consider organising a group to learn together, or presenting back what you've learned to other people.

## Formal training
You can book training through the people development form. Talk to #ask-learning-and-devt on slack if you have any questions.

Formal training can include:

- External training courses
- Conferences
- Civil service learning

## Informal training
Informal training can include:

- [Internal workshops](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/08/09/our-web-security-workshop-for-gds-developers/)
- Group study/activities
- User group meetups
- Attending [technospectives](https://trello.com/b/0T7BR3gT/technospectives) or other presentations

If you are interested in running a new workshop or group, first check if anyone has run anything similar before, as they may be able to share advice and materials.

## On the job learning

Many skills are best developed through working on a project as part of a team.

This can include:

- building and supporting software
- participating in code reviews
- attending incident reviews
- participating in show & tells
- writing and speaking about your work externally
