# The technologist's career path at GDS


The information in this section expands on the [technologists career path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) at GDS, which applies to the [Software Engineering community](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/communities-of-practice/software-engineering-1).

More generally, the civil service is adopting the [Digital, Data and Technology Profession Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), which outlines the various roles and responsibilities of technologists working in government. That framework covers a wider range of digital skills beyond just software engineering.
