# Designing for reliability

## The developers role

Writing code is a core part of software development, but our responsibility extends beyond that.

As a developer you are responsible for the whole release process, from code review to
deployment on a production system. You should also ensure that the products you are
working on are easy to support and operate.

### Junior level

Working with a more experienced developer, you should be able to produce code of a sufficient quality standard to ship to production.

You should [use automated testing](/career-path/competencies/using-appropriate-testing-to-ensure-software-quality.html) to ensure your code works.

### Mid level

At mid level, you should:

- reliably produce production ready code without assistance
- be able to operate software in production
- review pull requests raised by other members of your team
- anticipate ways that software components and infrastructure can fail

If working on the frontend, you should understand how to use progresssive enhancement and why it's important.

### Senior level

At senior level, you should

- understand how systems scale and plan for real world usage
- make sure your build process is repeatable across environments, so it is safe to deploy changes regularly
- monitor your software so you know that it is working in production and can inspect what it's doing
