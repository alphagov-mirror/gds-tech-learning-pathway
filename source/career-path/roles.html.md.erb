# Roles that are not job titles at GDS

## Technical lead
Any mid level or senior level technologist can act as the technical lead for a project.

This role is flexible - you can go back to a non-tech lead role after trying it out, and when deciding who should tech lead a team we prioritise exposing new people to the role.

## Incident lead
Anyone can take on a lead role during an incident.

For example, on GOV.UK there is a rota for platform support. If there is an incident, the first person on-call will typically become the incident lead.
