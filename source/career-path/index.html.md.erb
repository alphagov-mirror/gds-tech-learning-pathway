# The technologist's career path at GDS

The information in this section expands on the [technologists career path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) at GDS, which applies to the [Software Engineering community](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/communities-of-practice/software-engineering-1).

More generally, the civil service is adopting the [Digital, Data and Technology Profession Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), which outlines the various roles and responsibilities of technologists working in government. That framework covers a wider range of digital skills beyond just software engineering, and the structure of this website will change to match that.

## Competencies

Competencies are specific skills, behaviours, and knowledge that help you perform your role.

The list below elaborates on the kinds of competencies mentioned in the career path. The page on each one should define what we expect at junior, mid and senior level.

These competencies do not generally distinguish between developers, web operations engineers and site reliability engineers - this may change.
