# The technologist's career path at GDS

The information in this section expands on the [technologists career path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) at GDS, which applies to the [Software Engineering community](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/communities-of-practice/software-engineering-1).

More generally, the civil service is adopting the [Digital, Data and Technology Profession Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), which outlines the various roles and responsibilities of technologists working in government. That framework covers a wider range of digital skills beyond just software engineering.

## Progression within software engineering
The career path is designed to support the common paths for career progression within the software engineering community. Your line manager can explain the process for internal promotions at GDS and help you set objectives to support your career progression.

## Roles that are not job titles at GDS
### Technical lead
Any mid level or senior level technologist can act as the technical lead for a project.

This role is flexible - you can go back to a non-tech lead role after trying it out, and when deciding who should tech lead a team we prioritise exposing new people to the role.

### Incident lead
Anyone can take on a lead role during an incident.

For example, on GOV.UK there is a rota for platform support. If there is an incident, the first person on-call will typically become the incident lead.

## Competencies
Competencies are specific skills, behaviours, and knowledge that help you perform your role.

The list below elaborates on the kinds of competencies mentioned in the career path. The page on each one should define what we expect at junior, mid and senior level.

These competencies do not generally distinguish between developers, web operations engineers and site reliability engineers - this may change.

## Ways of learning at GDS

All civil servants are entitled to [5 days of learning and development each year](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/training-and-development-opportunities-in-the-the-civil-service).

Junior developers can use 20% of their time for learning, for example, by working on a self-contained project.

You can ask questions about learning and development in #ask-learning-and-devt on slack.

### Private study
It's ok to ask your team for time to study something.

Study materials could include books, videos, or guided tutorials.

GDS has a [library](https://gds-library.cloudapps.digital) and subscriptions to [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) that you can use.

If you know others with similar learning goals, consider organising a group to learn together, or presenting back what you've learned to other people.

### Formal training
You can book training through the people development form. Talk to #ask-learning-and-devt on slack if you have any questions.

Formal training can include:

- External training courses
- Conferences
- Civil service learning

### Informal training
Informal training can include:

- [Internal workshops](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/08/09/our-web-security-workshop-for-gds-developers/)
- Group study/activities
- User group meetups
- Attending [technospectives](https://trello.com/b/0T7BR3gT/technospectives) or other presentations

If you are interested in running a new workshop or group, first check if anyone has run anything similar before, as they may be able to share advice and materials.

### On the job learning

Many skills are best developed through working on a project as part of a team.

This can include:

- building and supporting software
- participating in code reviews
- attending incident reviews
- participating in show & tells
- writing and speaking about your work externally
