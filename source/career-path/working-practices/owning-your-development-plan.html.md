# Owning your development plan

Developers should take responsibility for their continued learning and
development by forming a development plan.

#### Your role as a developer

Developers should identify areas they are interested in and areas where they
have skill gaps and seek out suitable resources to help further their
understanding. This can be in the form of books, courses, self-study,
conferences, mentoring etc.

Your development plan should be reflected in your objective (for example under
the heading "What are you doing for personal development?") and discussed with
your line manager.

#### Junior level

You will probably have broad goals in your development plan as you become familiar
with the large surface area of modern development and web/dev ops.

As a junior you have 20% time where you can focus on things that will help your development such as tutorials, books and projects.

You also have the opportunity to to work on a project that is non-delivery related
but benefits GDS. A 20% project should have some specific learning outcomes and
pairing with other juniors is encouraged to help juniors support and learn from
each other.

There is a spreadsheet of suggested 20% time projects
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nrt4oZEMYZR_54SdKApzNrBDKgxafIiPpQSfb3taUDE/edit#gid=492186728).

You should discuss the project with your line manager before starting on it.

#### Mid level

Your development plan may begin to focus more on higher level concepts - how to
design maintainable and scalable solutions. Learning not only the intricacies of
code, but also other skills that go into developing software like user research
and writing good user stories. A mid level plan might also include some
mentoring and presenting to help spread knowledge through the organisation.

Specific technology learning might be project based, for example if you are
working on search you might delve into Elasticsearch.
