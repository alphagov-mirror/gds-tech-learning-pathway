# GDS Technology Community - Learning Pathways

This repo exists to bring together the GDS Technology community's collective knowledge and resources to support learning and development of technologists.

We want to:

- elaborate the [technolgist career pathways](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) in more detail
- create a set of curated guides, organised by topic, technology, constiuency, level. There may be multiple cross-cutting routes into the resources, but our aim is to cater for the most important needs of technogists.

For a first pass we are going to:

- create a page for each statement on the technologist career path which:
  - describes in a little more detail that particular quality, or ability
  - links to guides which would help to learn that
  
We also want to encourage learning collaboratively in community, and so we'll seek to provide ways for:

- people to offer and request mentorship
- people to share what they're wanting to learn so that they can join up with others wanting to learn the same things, or get support from others

However, this repo should not contain any personal names or information because we intend to make this repo public.
