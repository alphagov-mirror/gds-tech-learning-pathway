# GDS Technology Community - Learning Pathways

This repo exists to bring together the GDS Technology community's collective knowledge and resources to support the learning and development of technologists.

## Goals

We want to:

- create a set of curated guides, organised by topic, technology, constituency, level. There may be multiple cross-cutting routes into the resources. Our aim is to offer pathways which cater for the most important needs of technologists.
- elaborate the current [technologists career pathways within GDS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) in more detail, by creating a page for each competency statement in the career path.
- prepare for adopting the [DDaT career pathways within GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-job-roles-in-government#technical:-software-developer-) by documenting our current career pathway in more detail.

## Status

This repository is an early draft.  We are working to get the structure right, and will then be focussing on the learning at Junior level before trying to elaborate it.

[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome in the form of PRs.

## What is a competency statement?

The [technologists career path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) contains statements about the skills, behaviours and knowledge required at different levels (such as "Using a programming language", "Leading on getting well defined tasks from backlog to production"). We call these competency statements.

## Next steps

For a first pass we are going to:

- create a page for [each competency statement](/career-path/competencies/) on the technologist career path which:
  - describes in a little more detail that particular competency
  - describes the expectation at each level of expertise
  - links to guides which would help to learn that competency
- test whether this is helpful for Juniors in learning

## Longer term goals

We want to encourage learning collaboratively in community, and so we'll seek to provide ways for:

- people to offer and request mentorship
- people to share what they're wanting to learn so that they can join up with others wanting to learn the same things, or get support from others

However, this repo should not contain any personal names or information because we intend to make this repo public.
