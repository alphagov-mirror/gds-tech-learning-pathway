# GDS Technology Community - Learning Pathways

This repo exists to bring together the GDS Technology community's collective knowledge and resources to support the learning and development of technologists.

## Goals

We want to:

- elaborate the [technologists career pathways](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) in more detail, by creating a page for each competency statement in the career path
- create a set of curated guides, organised by topic, technology, constiuency, level. There may be multiple cross-cutting routes into the resources. Our aim is to offer pathways which cater for the most important needs of technogists.

## What is a competency statement?

The [technologists career path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) contains statements about the skills, behaviours and knowledge required at different levels (such as "Using a programming language", "Leading on getting well defined tasks from backlog to production"). We call these competency statements.

## Next steps

For a first pass we are going to:

- create a page for [each competency statement](/career-path/competencies/) on the technologist career path which:
  - describes in a little more detail that particular competency
  - links to guides which would help to learn that competency

## How to contribute

We're using github issues to track people working on things. If you'd like to contribute a guide or a competency statement:

1. open an issue to track the work. The title of the issue should say something like "Guide: java programming" or "Competency statement: Leading on getting well defined tasks from backlog to production". Add any notes you feel necessary in the body of the issue
2. clone the repo and make a PR for the proposed changes
3. ask in the [slack channel](https://govuk.slack.com/archives/tech-learning-path) for someone to review it

If you're not sure about anything, come and ask in the [slack channel](https://govuk.slack.com/archives/tech-learning-path)

## Longer term goals

We want to encourage learning collaboratively in community, and so we'll seek to provide ways for:

- people to offer and request mentorship
- people to share what they're wanting to learn so that they can join up with others wanting to learn the same things, or get support from others

However, this repo should not contain any personal names or information because we intend to make this repo public.
