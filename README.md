# GDS Technology Community - Learning Pathways

This repo exists to bring together the GDS Technology community's collective knowledge and resources to support the learning and development of technologists.

## Goals

We want to:

- elaborate the [technolgist career pathways](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) in more detail
- create a set of curated guides, organised by topic, technology, constiuency, level. There may be multiple cross-cutting routes into the resources. Our aim is to offer pathways which cater for the most important needs of technogists.

## First steps

For a first pass we are going to:

- create a page for [each competency statement](/career-path/competencies/) on the technologist career path which:
  - describes in a little more detail that particular competency
  - links to guides which would help to learn that competency

We also want to encourage learning collaboratively in community, and so we'll seek to provide ways for:

- people to offer and request mentorship
- people to share what they're wanting to learn so that they can join up with others wanting to learn the same things, or get support from others

However, this repo should not contain any personal names or information because we intend to make this repo public.
