## Puppet

Puppet is a domain specific language that describes the intended state of
computers. The name puppet is also used to refer to the software that runs on
those computers and makes configuration changes.

### Starting out

#### Which version?

The language does vary between versions. Most, but not all, of the basic
language from older versions, such as 2.x and 3.x, will work on newer versions. 

As a rule, start with the latest version, unless the team in which you work or
a tutorial you are following uses an older version.

#### Learning materials

# TODO: follow this tutorial with 4.x and make sure it still works
- [A tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20170507015216/http://www.pindi.us:80/blog/getting-started-puppet) that explains
  why you might want to use puppet and guides you through a getting started
  task. Old, but covers basics that haven't changed in newer versions.
- The [puppet cookbook](https://www.puppetcookbook.com/) has good examples of
  how to do specific things using puppet.
