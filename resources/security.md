# Security

Keeping up to date with security risks and best practices are necessary in keeping applications secure.

At GDS we regularly run security workshops, [this blog post](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/08/09/our-web-security-workshop-for-gds-developers/) has more information.

## Resources
