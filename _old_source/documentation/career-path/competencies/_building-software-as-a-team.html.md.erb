#### Building software as part of a team

##### The developer's role
Agile teams recognise that nothing is going to be perfect first time, but if we
release stuff regularly we can learn about and continuously improve products.

As developers it's important that we can easily respond to change, and teams can
continue to support products without relying on the original authors of the code
always being there (otherwise we could never take a holiday).

##### Junior level

You should:

- be familiar with the language and tools your team uses.
- follow coding conventions/styleguides for your language
- understand that code is read more often that it is written
- prefer to refactor and reuse code rather than duplicating it

##### Mid level

##### Senior level
